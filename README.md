# OpenMETA-Simulink

This example model and accompanying scripts demonstrate integration of an external domain tool into OpenMETA, without requiring OpenMETA metamodel changes or changes to the OpenMETA source code.

## Contents

  * `simulink-example.xme` - OpenMETA model containing example and test models using Simulink components, as well as test benches configured to drive the included OpenMETA to Simulink interpreter.
  * `python/CyPhySimulink.xme` - OpenMETA to Simulink Python interpreter.
  * `python/ComputeMetrics.py` - Support script for `TB_HierarchyWithOutput` test bench; takes CSV output from MATLAB/Simulink, computes metrics from that output, and merges them into the test bench manifest.
  * `matlab/CreateOrOverwriteModel.m` - MATLAB support function for code generated by the Python interpreter:  helper function which creates Simulink models regardless of whether or not they already exist.
  * `matlab/convertmat.m` - MATLAB support function for `TB_HierarchyWithOutput` test bench; used as the Simulink `StopFcn` and converts Simulink's `.mat` file output to CSV for consumption by Python.
  * `simulink/my_library.m` - Example Simulink model, used as a referenced model in the `PIDControllerReference` model, and as a user library in the `UserComponent` model.
